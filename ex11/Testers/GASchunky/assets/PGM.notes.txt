Notes on PGM format for creating chunky bitmaps:

- Load source image into gimp.
- Desaturate to greyscale (choose method for best contrast).
- Rescale image (output will be 4x larger due to b/w dither).
- Adjust levels.
- Posturize to 17 shades (equidistant shades for 4x4 dither matrix).
- Save as pgm in ASCII format.
